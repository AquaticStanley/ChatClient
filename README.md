# ChatClient

This is a C++ based chat client to use with the ChatServer server.

Being C++ based on compatibility with the unix standard header, it is intended to be ran on Unix based systems, such as Linux and Mac OS.

This client is intended to remain somewhat bare-bones, primariliy for testing, speed, and compatibility.
